# PersonalWebsite
My personal website's generating script in Python.

## Description

The script I've used to generate the HTML code for my website. It's a bit hacky, but it does its job and is pretty extensible to new features. Creative inspiration was pulled from quite a few blogs, in particular Scott Aaronson's blog, which I found well-designed and easy to navigate.

To generate the HTML, go into the cloned directory and run `cd backend && python3 generate`.
