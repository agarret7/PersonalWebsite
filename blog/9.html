    The Emergence of the Quantified Self<br>

  </h2>
  
        <p>Today we are experiencing an explosion of a new culture that is motivated by the idea of transcending our limitations. It is a meme that is spreading and evolving in forms that encompass transhumanism, biohacking, technologists, and anyone who ever got excited about next-generation smartphones. This idea, while maybe not yet mainstream, has definitely been growing in size in the past few years. We can see its proliferation across the internet, as a new culture of self-aware blogs and videos, that realize the amazing potential of the very medium they are using to transmit ideas and data.</p>
  
        <p>Part of this movement, there exists a contemporary part called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">Quantified Self</a>. This is where the modern age hits the technology of the future. A real wave is sweeping throughout the world with the idea that we can monitor our own well-being and take our healthcare into our own hands. Small sensors that we wear or even implant in our bodies can record a constant stream of information, telling us precisely when things go wrong.</p>
  
        <p>Certainly this technology is a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a>. We have a while to go before it is refined to the point of becoming nearly necessary, but the idea itself is one of monumental proportions. People themselves are unknowingly entering into this future of scientific self-experimentation.</p>
  
        <p>This is just a single example of <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/guide/">technologies</a> that are emerging that involve people taking measurements of their own health. As these devices get smaller, more powerful, and more dynamic, they will exponentially produce more data which each individual can use to control their own health.</p>
  
        <p>Feeding this rich content and uploading it onto the internet allows new conclusions to emerge - new ways for scientists to understand how humanity functions as a whole. We are, as Jason Silva puts it, "pooling the data from millions of people, eventually finding patterns in the data, learning how to optimize the way the data is managed, feeding that information back into ourselves, transforming what it means to be a human being running at optimum capacity."</p>
  
        <p>People are becoming more accepting of bio-hacking in the form of extrapolating the scientific mindset to the exploration of personalized medicine. The future consists of a paradigm shift that will include the small-scale production of information. We are evolving from natural consumers to a two-way street, as producer/consumers. Part of this movement will include using devices to monitor our own health. The future is bright, and technology will play a large part in facilitating a new movement toward self-improvement and healthy living. How will the Quantified Self movement change the idea of health care and affect the use of medicine and treatment in the next 10 years?</p>
