        <p>Today let's talk about respirocytes. I briefly mentioned them previously on my blog, along with their potential applications. I want to expand upon what I previously said with information I gathered from the source material itself, along with fleshing out some ideas of further applications of similar devices. <a href="3.html">[1086 more words]</a></p>

        <p>This just in: I just found out about a VR headset called the <a href="https://www.avegant.com/">Avegant Glyph</a>. It provides it's virtual imaging technology through the use of a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_retinal_display">Virtual Retinal Display</a>. Although providing a slightly less wide FOV than the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus Rift</a>, it supposedly gives twice the definition with little to no eye strain because of the inherent nature of the technology which uses reflective light. <a href="4.html">[139 more words]</a></p>

        <p>Today we are experiencing an explosion of a new culture that is motivated by the idea of transcending our limitations. It is a meme that is spreading and evolving in forms that encompass transhumanism, biohacking, technologists, and anyone who ever got excited about next-generation smartphones. This idea, while maybe not yet mainstream, has definitely been growing in size in the past few years. We can see its proliferation across the internet, as a new culture of self-aware blogs and videos, that realize the amazing potential of the very medium they are using to transmit ideas and data. <a href="5.html">[363 more words]</a></p>

        <p>The future of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> development is documented extremely well in this video. Especially important is the consideration that artificial intelligence will arise as a result of computer learning developments, not simply programmed rules. This is also an argument for the time frame we can expect artificial intelligence to arise from. A lot of rules emerge naturally from a learning machine, and although building such a creation will be an immense problem, one that may be humanities greatest and most influential problem, it is all but inevitable that it shall come to pass. <a href="6.html">[412 more words]</a></p>

        <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic">nootropic</a> is a drug that is specifically designed to increase mental performance through things like increased attention, neural plasticity, and memory. In the past, chemical nootropics have been used to help children with diseases such as ADD or ADHD to focus on specific tasks whereas normally they would be unable to function appropriately. Recently, however, these drugs have been researched as potential cognitive enhancers, separated from the disease-treating mentality that they often were confined to previously. <a href="9.html">[912 more words]</a></p>

        <p>Happy New Years! Starting off 2014, let's discuss the future of neural simulation. For quite some time now, several projects since the start of the decade have been aimed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_brain">recreating the human brain in a virtual environment</a>. The applications would be profound and wide reaching. Firstly, it would go a long way in objectively diagnosing and treating certain types of mental disorders. We could look directly into the brain to see what goes wrong when certain cognitive diseases take hold. We could also work on new drugs that could be virtually tested to see a close approximation of the effects before ever having to do clinical trials. <a href="10.html">[590 more words]</a></p>

        <p>Just since 2010 there has been an upsurge in the popularity of life extension technologies. Opposing the "wrinkle removing" substances that claimed to use natural herbs to "reverse the aging process", there have been new groups arising that have instead actually been researching the healthy extension of life, with the goal of eventually suspending and even reversing the biological aging process of humans. New groups, such as the <a href="http://www.sens.org/">Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS)</a> have been at the forefront of advocating for aging to be considered as a disease. <a href="12.html">[761 more words]</a></p>
