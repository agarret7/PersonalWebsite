  </h2>
  
        <p>First of all, let me apologize for the lack of posts. I really would prefer this blog not to die after such a short number of posts, especially for how well it was going to quickly. I need to provide my own incentive, because I know very few read this blog, but I won't let that deter me from my goal. Now on to my post.</p>
  
        <p>Virtual Reality was really hyped up during the 1990's. A combination of a few simple breakthroughs and media surrounding virtual reality led to massive expectations of virtual reality in the future. However, after these expectations fell through, people became disillusioned and dropped the subject during the 2000's. Besides a few minor breakthroughs in things like the virtual world of Second Life, virtual reality had become an absolute failure, and was unlikely to emerge in any substantial form for decades at least.</p>
  
        <p>Or so they thought.</p>
  
        <p>Virtual reality has beautifully modeled what is called the Gartner Hype Cycle. As can be seen in the picture below, what it represents is a series of stages which show the different periods of a technology's hype in the public.</p>
  
        <p><center></p>
  
        <p>  <img src="../backend/media/7-1.png"></img></p>
  
        <p></center></p>
  
        <p>If you look at the graph of several technologies currently talked about in the media or in the public sphere, you can see that "Virtual Worlds" is right near the bottom of the hype cycle. Virtual reality served no purpose in the interests of people at large.</p>
  
        <p>However, this has begun to change. Already, virtual reality is climbing the "Plateau of Productivity". New systems and devices are being implemented with the capabilities of virtual reality that were previously unheard of for consumer prices. The <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus Rift</a> is one of the most prominent of these examples. It claims that it will offer visual virtual reality with high definition for a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/07/16/oculus-rift-targets-300-price-point-wants-to-be-free/#56c0d7c65283">targeted price of around $300</a>. This is ridiculously exciting because it means that, as opposed to things like <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/16/laying-the-virtual-boy-to-rest">Virtual Boy</a>, we will finally have devices that allow for a much more immersive experience with full color.</p>
  
        <p>But there's more. Another, complimentary device called the <a href="http://www.virtuix.com/">Omni</a> is looking for a $600 price range for an omni-directional treadmill. What we see with these two devices can simply be described as game-changing.</p>
  
        <p>As you can see, Virtual Reality is coming quite some way from the old clunky interfaces of its ancestors. Combine some good motion tracking, and you start to be able to interact with the world around you. The potential applications have been widely covered in the past.</p>
  
        <p>We already know that the more immersive a technology is, the more likely it is to pull people more toward it than the real world. Those who have less to gain from the real world are naturally more susceptible to living in a virtual one; we can already see the trend in things like World of Warcraft. A book recently explored this option, called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a></i>. Besides being an excellent book, it explores what near-full immersion virtual reality's impact would have on the world.</p>
  
        <p>These new devices are interesting and all, but what excites me to a large degree is full-immersion virtual reality. Essentially, this virtual reality artificially blocks the neuronal input of our natural senses, and instead produces new sensations to be directly given to our brain. Additionally, it takes our brain's mechanical output and translates that into movements in the virtual world. This type is obviously the more advanced, but we could begin to see it in a few decades. In many ways, depending on the finesse of the sensory interception and translation, this world would be indistinguishable from the real world.</p>
  
        <p>This most likely would be achieved through nanotechnology and an array of miniaturized devices which attach to each of the neurons in the brain. These simulations would be very near to what you could find in the real world, with the exception of limitless powers afforded to those within the simulation. The applications are breathtaking; this apparatus would allow us to experience nearly every possible situation imaginable. As a creative and collaborative tool, it would be likely as impacting as the internet itself. It would fundamentally change how people would interact; it's likely that it would become nearly pointless for people to exist outside of this world. Why would you, when you can receive the same realism in an artificial environment?</p>
  
        <p>The result may be that humans stop interacting with the real world in favor of an artificial one. But this artificial one would not be a substitute for the real one. It would allow people to work comfortably and securely with the smallest amount of real resources available. Real-world solutions could be created in an artificial environment, allowing people to comfortably exist within a virtual world without fear of their real destruction.</p>
  
        <p>The poor would no longer have to suffer; they would be equalized with the wealthiest nations on the planet. They would have access to education, comforts, and jobs that before couldn't be conceived of. Within the confines of their real body, all they have to do is preserve their physical structure, which would become immensely easier because of the reduced resources required to preserve them. It's very likely that virtual reality will be a mental liberator from the confines of the real world, while detracting nothing from the human spirit, strength, or status. Who's to say we won't even become virtual ourselves?</p>
  
        <p>As a last interesting note, based on more sci-fi than fact (meaning take this with a grain of salt), virtual reality is currently unable to simulate reality perfectly. However, we have been able to simulate very small portions of the universe, the size of nuclei, down to perfect universal laws. This means these particles are simulated perfectly under the rules of our universe and behave essentially the same. It is theoretically possible that within a few hundred years, we could expand this to the size of kilometers, meaning we could perfectly simulate the universe on a large scale. </p>
  
        <p>This would make participating in the real world almost completely redundant. Besides maintaining the medium in which we exist, in this virtual reality, we could do anything we want with detail the equivalent of the real universe. If this were to ever develop, it's very likely that if you were to encounter humanity in the future, all you would see is a gigantic piece of machinery, surrounded by swarms of nanobots allowing for external applications. All of humanity would be self-contained within these machines though, and would extend themselves into the outside only in order to:</p>
  
        <p>1. Expand their current abilities and computational power.</p>
  
        <p>2. Interact with non-virtual entities.</p>
  
        <p>It's an interesting side note, but again, it's all highly speculative and only a single possibility. However, even considering the vast possibilities of things like full-immersion virtual reality, we can see that these new technologies are likely to revolutionize the way we communicate on a level equal to if not exceeding the impact of the internet. That's an exciting thought.</p>
