        <p>On Quora, an individual asked "What would atheists do if God had shown undeniable proof that He is real?" This led me to the rejection of the premise that any piece of evidence can be used to argue for the existence of God. Only through faith can one accept the premise of God. <a href="0.html">[1408 more words]</a></p>

        <p>We live in the middle ground between future and past. Obviously, this statement is a bit vague, so let me clarify what I mean; in the past, communication technology was in a state of relative penury to today. Whether we were using  letters, Morse code, telephones, radio, or even television, the quality and speed of transmission of information was of comparatively negligible quality. Each had their downfalls, and while the latter technologies replaced many of the inefficiencies of previous ones, they still withheld nowhere near the same level of quality or speed that the internet espouses today. <a href="1.html">[468 more words]</a></p>

        <p>Artificial intelligence is a task quite unlike anything we've ever attempted before. Certainly, it will be incredibly demanding on our ability to engineer and create new computing systems. However, our ability to understand ourselves may be more important than anything else. Our brains are incredibly complex organs; without quoting one of the countless sayings about how strange it is, rest assured that it is the most complex system we may know about within biology, or perhaps in the universe itself. <a href="2.html">[285 more words]</a></p>

        <p>Today we are experiencing an explosion of a new culture that is motivated by the idea of transcending our limitations. It is a meme that is spreading and evolving in forms that encompass transhumanism, biohacking, technologists, and anyone who ever got excited about next-generation smartphones. This idea, while maybe not yet mainstream, has definitely been growing in size in the past few years. We can see its proliferation across the internet, as a new culture of self-aware blogs and videos, that realize the amazing potential of the very medium they are using to transmit ideas and data. <a href="5.html">[363 more words]</a></p>

        <p>The future of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> development is documented extremely well in this video. Especially important is the consideration that artificial intelligence will arise as a result of computer learning developments, not simply programmed rules. This is also an argument for the time frame we can expect artificial intelligence to arise from. A lot of rules emerge naturally from a learning machine, and although building such a creation will be an immense problem, one that may be humanities greatest and most influential problem, it is all but inevitable that it shall come to pass. <a href="6.html">[412 more words]</a></p>

        <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic">nootropic</a> is a drug that is specifically designed to increase mental performance through things like increased attention, neural plasticity, and memory. In the past, chemical nootropics have been used to help children with diseases such as ADD or ADHD to focus on specific tasks whereas normally they would be unable to function appropriately. Recently, however, these drugs have been researched as potential cognitive enhancers, separated from the disease-treating mentality that they often were confined to previously. <a href="9.html">[912 more words]</a></p>
