    Intelligence and the Emergence of Strong AI<br>

        <p>Why not start my blog off with a post about Artificial Intelligence? Firstly, we need to create a specific definition of intelligence. A perfectly intelligent system for n nodes is, by definition, a system that is able to best take an input, and give the quickest and best desired output, and thus has the smallest latency that is physically possible between nodes, with the least number of errors in communication, with the highest order complexity given the physical properties of the system itself, using the simplest method possible to obtain the highest desired output (or the output with the greatest coherency).</p>
  
        <p>A system that has high intelligence for a specific input is said to have a higher <strong>narrow</strong> intelligence in that field. For example, a chess playing program has narrow intelligence in chess, to the point that said program will surpass even the best of humans in this narrow field. On the other hand, a system that has high intelligence for a broader range of inputs is said to have a higher <i>general</i> intelligence. For example, a human being has greater general intelligence than a robot as of this moment because of a human's ability to receive a broader range of input allows it to more accurately achieve a higher desired output, often with a much simpler method of achieving it.</p>
  
        <p>As a note, there is no clear distinction between general and narrow intelligence, but for the purpose of my argument, we will classify narrow intelligence as the ability for a system to work within a field subjectively limited to a clearly finite amount of variables and inputs, while general intelligence is the ability for a system to work within a field containing unknown or uncountable variables and inputs. There is no such thing as a system with perfect general intelligence; such a system would just be a system perfectly capable, to the extent of physical limitations, of achieving a desired output for all possible inputs contained within the universe. It would subjectively be narrow intelligence, where the input field and variables is the universe itself. Such a system would be omniscient, and would require the universe to be made into a perfectly intelligent system in order to compute.</p>
  
        <p>Let's examine the intelligence of a human. A human has a relatively high latency between nodes, with a high amount of errors, that can be alleviated only slightly by meta-scale correction by a feedback loop that takes place when the error is recognized by the sensory systems of a human, and then create a new output based off of the perceived error. i.e. you see that you misspelled a word, erase it, and then rewrite it. Instead of correcting individual steps of neuron pathways, we have to recognize the error once we've made it, then correct it. In addition, the human neural net has a relatively high complexity, with the greatest level of coherency for general intelligence in any discovered system as of yet. This coherency is the strongest suit of humans and is the basis for our superior general intelligence. It is a result of the parallel computing and analog-based connectome that allows for a much less linear and much more abstract line of reasoning to take place within the brain. This, combined with hormones flooding every system of our body makes us incredibly adaptive and strong-suited to survive in an unpredictable world. We need general intelligence because we evolved in a field demanding us to adapt to a massive host of issues and problems.</p>
  
        <p>Now, we examine how a computer's intelligence compares. A computer has a latency that is nearly negligible between transistors, with a very small amount of errors, which can be corrected by protocols designed to resend information that is lost in transmission. The layout of a transistor has a massive level of complexity that is thousands of times smaller than neurons. However, the level of coherency for general intelligence in computers is small, not comparable to any neural system that is possessed by even the most basic of organisms. Computers use massive algorithms and uncountable levels of calculations to produce even a moderate quality output for an arbitrary input used to classify general intelligence. They are linear, and are developed by humans to address the weaknesses of our own evolution. They are adapted to work in a regulated, controlled environment, and to receive designated inputs that are all known.</p>
  
        <p>In the narrow range of intelligence, the coherency of a computer can be focused down to a single task, not requiring the massive parallel computing capabilities of the brain. Thus, the computer eliminates the wide-range advantages of human intelligence, and surpasses humans in such a field. Chess playing robots can beat world-level champions because the brute force method of calculating all possibilities and selecting the most advantageous one becomes possible for the machine. It isn't required to have a high level of coherency; the field is narrowed so that it is within the realm of the computer's force-method. Chess players do not think the same way as computers, they rely on the coherency of their intelligence to make decisions. However, as the field is incredibly specific, this coherency is less and less important, and the machine becomes more and more capable.</p>
  
        <p>Humans have become more and more demanding of computers' adaptability; we want them to give us a wider range of responses then just a single output. When we talk about machines gaining the ability to feed these desires, we are talking about increasing their coherency. In conjunction with the ability for a machine to calculate more and more efficiently, machines are also increasing the coherency of their computations. More efficient algorithms with increases in parallel computing allow for a lesser amount of work while achieving an even more accurate output. This is being done through a conjunction of creating computer systems designed after the brain's parallel computing powers, along with evolution-based approaches to letting computer programs reprogram themselves based on which system is most intelligent. This results in a much more organic-looking machine then ones seen previously, with systems gaining adaptability and learning abilities.</p>
  
        <p>We can see the trend in the increasingly general fields that machines are now beginning to dominate human competitors. The weight of the newly gained coherency of the machine's mind, along with their massively advantageous traits of small latency and high complexity are equaling out with the immense coherency of the human brain, in a wider range of fields. First, computers could beat humans at arithmetic, a very specific field. Then they began to trump humans in chess, then they were able to diagnose diseases better than doctors could, and recently they gained the ability to beat human competitors in Jeopardy - a trivia game that requires a high level knowledge of human language to be competitive in.</p>
  
        <p>In the next few years, the coherency of AI will begin to rival that of humans in speech and communication. The general intelligence of robots is increasing through their increasing coherency. When a computer has equal coherency of the human mind, it will have already surpassed human general intelligence by billions of times, because it already has the capabilities to outperform humans in latency, complexity, and error correction. The lines between narrow and general intelligence is being blurred for many people. As machines become more capable of achieving human level coherency, the field of their intelligence will expand, eventually meeting human's for a brief instant before surpassing us exponentially, leading to the emergence of strong AI.</p>
  
        <p>I have so much more to talk about on this subject, but this post covers the very basics of my ideas on the emergence of strong AI; it's really just an accumulation of Ray Kurzweil's theory of exponential progression, combined with deductions based off of other literature I've come across. I'll probably revisit this topic later to expand on some more ideas, but these are the basics.</p>
