Respirocytes
11th February 2014

Today let's talk about respirocytes. I briefly mentioned them previously on my blog, along with their potential applications. I want to expand upon what I previously said with information I gathered from the source material itself, along with fleshing out some ideas of further applications of similar devices.

First of all, the article I will be referencing is <a href="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html">here</a>; it is a part of the Foresight Institute, which was established as a supporter of nanotech and research of its potentials. As a bit of a brief history - it has offered rewards in the past for those who are able to meet a variety of challenges that they pose. The name of their prizes are called Feynman Prizes, in honor of Feynman who is often credited with bringing attention to the possibilities of nanotechnology. They have a range of cash rewards available to anyone who is perceived to have promoted the original ideas that Feynman presented during his lectures.

The Foresight Institute is currently hosting a document written by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Freitas">Robert A. Freitas Jr.</a>, who has previously involved himself in creating theoretical creations under the single pretense that an atomically precise nanofabricator is available. An example of some of his more radical conceptions is the vasculoid - a completely solid replacement for the circulatory system within the human body. Today, we'll just be focusing on the respirocyte. In my previous post on <a href="3.html">Nanotechnology</a> I said

<blockquote>These devices have over 200 times the efficiency of an organic red blood cell. If someone were to replace 10% of their blood with these artificial versions, they would be able to not take a breath for hours, or to run an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes on a single breath.</blockquote>

That's the outward effect of these devices. What are some of the technical aspects though? Without going into too much detail - I'll leave that for you guys to probe on the article yourselves - I'd like to summarize a few key points of these devices, then further discuss potential applications and maybe even some future refinements and expansions to the technology which would add to the ability for these devices to function.

<h3>Technical Aspects and Specifications</h3>

First of all, the device is approximated to be around 1 micron in diameter. To give a sense of scale, a normal erythrocyte has a diameter of around 6.2â€“8.2 microns, so this device would be around 1/6 - 1/8 the size of a normal blood cell. They would be made of a nanodiamond structure of an atomically perfect arrangement of carbon atoms. They would be roughly spherical, and have a variety of sensors and pumps on the outside.

This is a diagram of a top-down view of the respirocyte. As you can see, there is an oxygen gas chamber on the left side, and a carbon dioxide gas chamber on the right. The tanks each have a maximum pressure density of 100,000 atm, but this is reduced to 1,000 atm for saftey reasons. The majority of the surface is taken up by pumps which are powered by glucose engines, as can be seen on the top and bottom parts of the diagram. In the middle, there is a ballast of water in order to stabilize the structure and prevent buckling. In the very middle is a nanoelectronic device, also powered by the glucose engines. It has a computing capability of around 10^4 bits per seconds - plenty of power for the actions needed to be taken by the respirocyte.

The pumps work by sensing relative pressure inside the tanks and the amount of oxygen outside, and use the nanocomputer to decide when to activate.

Through the use of a rotating pump, it is able to selectively pick molecules and pass them into the interior. Several gates prevent impurities from entering the chambers, thereby allowing for pure oxygen to be carried. Oxygen is released in the body, and the respirocytes are recharged in the lungs. As previously stated, with their immense oxygen density, and the absence of a need for chemical storage, respirocytes are about 200 times as efficient as natural blood cells.

There would be a type of "barcode" consisting of concentric circles of atoms on the exterior surface of the respirocyte, to allow for identification. This will also come into play in future applications, as you will see.

To program the device, all a physician would need to do is use an acoustic vibration system to send messages to the computer within the device. This could allow for a dynamic range of actions that can be controlled externally.

<h3>Redundancies</h3>

A redundancy is a purposeful inclusion of a repetition of an aspect of the respirocyte in order to prevent mechanical failures and ensure longevity for the device. Each device has at least 10 times the required amount of sensors, pumps, glucose engines, and computational ability in order to protect from failures. The pressure is kept at 1% maximum potential, and thus minimizes potential risk for damage or loss of respirocytes.

Keep in mind, the respirocytes still function at 200 times the efficiency of natural erythrocytes, even with these redundancies and unnecessary additions for safety. There would even be built-in programming for the respirocyte to release all oxygen once exposed to regular atmospheric conditions, for safety reasons. The potential for damage is minimal, and the overall design has been thoroughly considered.

<h3>Improvements and the Future</h3>

Respirocytes have been thoroughly thought out, and although they are not possible to make today, in the future it's very likely that the invention of a nanofabricator will allow for a device similar to this, or even more efficient, to be created. There are even some possible expansions of the functionality of this device. Perhaps drugs could be loaded into a separate container, for specific deployment to certain parts of the body. Relaxations in the safety requirements could cut the energy by an order of magnitude, or increase functionality by more than 1000%.

The barcode system can allow for future, even more advanced devices to recognize the respirocytes and act based on programmed aspects. Essentially what we can see with the respirocyte is more than just an synthetic red blood cell. It is a container, a vessel, with programmable aspects. It is incredible strong and has massive potential. With the advent of molecular nanotechnology, it is certain we will see many more devices like these.

In the future, I'll update my blog with other potential devices, possibly from this same author, or maybe even more radical things like the artificial nucleus. Again, if you want to read on these amazing devices in meticulous detail, I strongly encourage you to take a peak at <a href="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html#TOC">his writing</a>.
